# School District Analysis
## Overview
Tasked with pulling and cleaning up student data for the purpose of analyzing school performance based on students test scores and school budgets.  
## Findings 
Based off the minimal analysis of the School data I have found that Charter schools generally do more with less.  The Charter schoolsâ€™ average budget was about $38,000 less than the public schools, but the charter schools outperformed the public schools in math scores in all grades but 12th.  In grades 9-11 the charter schools averaged 6 percentage points higher than public schools.  In the 12th grade the public schools did outperform the charter schools by 3 percentage points.  
## Discoveries
In the comparison phase I found that when working to compare the schools budgets the mean figures were not accurate.  Earlier we eliminated duplicate values but that did not consider each figure for school budget was listed for each student.  This causes the numbers to be off since some schools with lower budgets might have more kids causing the average budget for that type of school to be lower than the actual.   
## Additional Analysis
There are many other comparisons we could perform with this data.  We could look at math and reading scores together compared with the school budgets to see if budget has a direct correlation to students test scores.  It would be interesting to look at each school before looking at what type.  This could help us to understand better if there is a correlation between scores and if a school is a charter or public school.
